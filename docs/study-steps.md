# Study steps (follow in order)

Tick the matching boxes in [../progress.md](../progress.md). Do not skip Domain 1.

> **Sequencing lives in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)** — it interleaves these steps with the Academy course C sections. This file remains the canonical numbering for `progress.md`.

All five domains are full teaching tracks. **Do not wait** — start Domain 1 now (highest exam weight).

---

## Phase 0 — Orientation (once)

1. Register on Anthropic Academy (done if ticked in `progress.md`).
2. Read `docs/exam-overview.md`.
3. Read `docs/exam-strategy.md`.
4. Read `docs/scenarios.md`.
5. Read `cheatsheets/decision-rules.md` once end-to-end. Keep it open while you study.

You are also sitting the **official Anthropic Academy** courses listed under “Prepare for this exam”. Track them in `progress.md` (A–G). Map and pairing: [academy-courses.md](academy-courses.md).

Do not finish all seven courses before Domain 1. Start **C (Building with the Claude API)** alongside Phase 1. Skip Bedrock/GCP unless that is your production host.

## Phase 1 — Domain 1 (27%) — highest priority

For **each** task file: read it → answer the check questions (in chat or on paper) → only then open the next file.

6. `domains/01-agentic-architecture/1.1-agentic-loops.md`  
   Then answer: premature-stop bug (`content[0].type == "text"`) — what is wrong, what is the fix.
7. `1.2-multi-agent-orchestration.md`
8. `1.3-subagent-invocation.md`
9. `1.4-workflow-enforcement.md`
10. `1.5-sdk-hooks.md`
11. `1.6-task-decomposition.md`
12. `1.7-session-state.md`
13. Sit `domains/01-agentic-architecture/practice.md` (target **8/10**).
14. Hands-on: `docs/exercises.md` exercise 1 (support agent + real loop + refund gate).

If step 13 is below 8/10, re-read the missed task files. Do not start Domain 2 yet.

---

## Phase 2 — Domain 2 (18%) then Domain 5 (15%)

Same rhythm: one file, check questions, next file.

15. Domain 2 files `2.1` → `2.5` (same rhythm as Domain 1: check questions after each)
16. Domain 2 `practice.md` (7 questions, target **6/7**), then exercise 5 in `docs/exercises.md`
17. Domain 5 files `5.1` → `5.6` (check questions after each)
18. Domain 5 `practice.md` (6 questions, target **5/6**)
19. Extend exercise 1 with structured errors, case facts, and a self-contained handoff  
    **or** start `docs/exercises.md` exercise 4 (research pipeline).

---

## Phase 3 — Domain 3 (20%) then Domain 4 (20%)

20. Domain 3 files `3.1` → `3.6` (check questions after each)
21. Domain 3 `practice.md` (8 questions, target **7/8**)
22. Hands-on: exercise 2 (hierarchy, glob rules, forked skill, CI `-p` + JSON)
23. Domain 4 files `4.1` → `4.6` (check questions after each)
24. Domain 4 `practice.md` (8 questions, target **7/8**)
25. Hands-on: exercise 3 (schema + few-shot + validation-retry on 10 documents)

---

## Phase 4 — Lock it together

26. Finish exercise 4 if you skipped it in phase 2.
27. Recite `cheatsheets/decision-rules.md` from memory; mark gaps against `cheatsheets/anti-patterns.md`.
28. Sit `practice/mixed-set.md` (target **10/12**).
29. Work the sample questions in the official Exam Guide (section 9). There is no official practice exam; it was retired at the June 2026 move to Pearson.
30. Re-read **only** the task files you missed. No new topics.

## Daily rule

One task-statement file per sitting. Say the mechanism out loud. Two questions. Tick `progress.md`. Stop.

## Exam week

Decision rules + anti-patterns only. Sleep.
